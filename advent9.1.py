# Part 1
#
# The data is interleaved 'block then gap'
# We move the block to our 'nogaps' list, then try to fill the gap. 
# we do this by repeatedly popping a block off the end of the block list, 
# and using as much of it as we can.

# Part 2
#
# Now we are moving whole files at a time.
# We make a priority queue for each gap size, sorted by gap position.
# For each block, we look at all the gaps it will fit in, keeping the earlier
# and pushing all the others back. We put the file in that gap if it exists,
# and if it's *to the left of the current position*
# This means we're going to have to recreate our block and gap list, keeping
# track of the initial positions this time.
